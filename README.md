README
======

Holding documents for the DataCamp Take Home Test.

I created a copy of the assignment [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9UgG2my-0JiP2ucIDRosMjIzmalSPGH9BWAAPMBXpg/edit#).

Time Breakdown
--------------

* 20 minutes: Reading the document, checking out the example track, creating
  git repo.
* 30 minutes: Figuring out the details of the course outline & getting it down
  in markdown. Figuring out how to present the contents.
* 45 minutes: Writing a course outline
  * The course outline went through multiple drafts as I wrote & delete
    chapters while figuring out scope, which had to get trimmed, a lot (as one
    would expect).
* 45 minutes: writing the sample problem
* 15 minutes: polishing just a bit.
